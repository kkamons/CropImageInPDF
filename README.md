cropImg.py is a basic image cropping tool

My dad used a scanner to digitize old family photos, only to find that they were stored uncropped in many PDF files.  Each PDF file contained multiple pictures, each on a single page in the PDF document. My dad then found expensive software to automate the cropping process for him.

To run at the command line:
python cropImg.py sourceFolder destinationFolder
